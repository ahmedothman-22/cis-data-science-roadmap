## 1. Introduction  

Data Science isn’t just about coding or math – it’s about **asking the right questions** and **finding smart solutions using data**.  

In this journey, you will learn step by step:  
1. **Foundations** → Programming, Math, and Statistics  
2. **Analysis** → Understanding and visualizing data  
3. **Machine Learning** → Building models and predictions  
4. **Deep Learning** → Neural networks and advanced AI  
5. **Projects** → Applying everything to real-world problems  

By the end, you’ll not only know *what Data Science is*, but also *where you fit*:  
- Do you enjoy analyzing? → You may become a **Data Analyst**  
- Do you love coding? → You may become a **Machine Learning Engineer (with Deep Learning)**  
- Do you love mixing everything? → You’re on the way to being a **Data Scientist**  



## 2. Levels

The roadmap is divided into 4 main levels, each level will be divided into weeks and each week will have a set of tasks to be completed. We will try to provide task links one by one when it's finished. Each level is designed to be completed within 1-3 months on average, however, the time taken to complete the roadmap may vary depending on the individual.

1. [**Entry**](#entry): Good introduction to the field.
2. [**Beginner**](#beginner): Data scientist toolkit and foundations.
3. [**Intermediate**](#intermediate): Dive deeper and solidly understand and work with data.
4. [**Advanced A**](#advanced-a): Mathematics and Machine Learning.
5. [**Advanced B**](#advanced-b): Deep Learning and specializing in a specific field.
