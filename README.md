## 1. Introduction
Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that works with raw and structured datasets to generate actionable insights.  
It combines **Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics**.  
Data Scientists use techniques such as **machine learning, linear regression, predictive modeling**, and tools like **Python** and **R**.

## 2. Levels
The roadmap is divided into 5 levels:

1. **Entry** â†’ Introduction to the field.  
2. **Beginner** â†’ Data Scientist toolkit & foundations.  
3. **Intermediate** â†’ Data analysis, cleaning & SQL.  
4. **Advanced A** â†’ Mathematics & Machine Learning.  
5. **Advanced B** â†’ Deep Learning, Transformers & NLP.  

Each level is split into weeks with resources + tasks.
